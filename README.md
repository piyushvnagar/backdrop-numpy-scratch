This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a shallow neural network with one hidden layer using backpropagation for binary classification. It covers parameter initialization, forward and backward passes, loss computation, and parameter updates using gradient descent. The notebook then applies this model to a dogs vs. cats image classification dataset to illustrate its use on real-world data and discusses the limitations of this architecture for computer vision tasks, as well as concepts like overfitting and learning rate.
